# iQuhacks Quantum Hackathon - Failed Attempt

This repository contains my failed attempt at the iQuhacks Quantum Hackathon.

## Description

Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, I was unable to successfully complete the hackathon project. This README serves as a documentation of my journey and the challenges I faced along the way.

## Challenges Faced

- Lack of prior experience with quantum computing
- Limited time to learn and implement quantum algorithms
- Technical difficulties with the required software and hardware

## Lessons Learned

Although this attempt was not successful, I gained valuable insights and knowledge throughout the process. Here are some of the lessons I learned:

- Importance of thorough preparation and understanding of the problem domain
- Need for a solid foundation in quantum computing principles and algorithms
- Value of collaboration and seeking help from experienced mentors

## Future Plans

While this attempt may not have been successful, I am determined to continue my journey in the field of quantum computing. I plan to further enhance my skills and knowledge and participate in future hackathons and projects.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to the organizers of the iQuhacks Quantum Hackathon for providing this opportunity and to all the mentors who supported me throughout the event.
